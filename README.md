# Quantum Simulation

This project was going to just try and simulate a quantum computer for a limited number of qubits.

However, having learnt* the basics of Quantum computing in terms of complex numbers, tensor products and unitary
matrices, it seems like trying to provide a way to write quantum algorithms with these traditional constructs
might be confusing...

So I'm looking for a way to express Quantum algorithms more intuitively.

##### [The Maths of Simulating a Quantum Computer](TheMathsOfSimulatingaQuantumComputer)
* Basic **Mathematics** involved in Quantum Algorithms.
* Explains enough for you to write your own simulator!

##### [Deutsch Jozsa Algorithm](DeutschJozsaAlgorithm)
* Explains a really simple quantum algorithm in detail.
* Demonstrates how to construct a **Quantum Oracle**.<span style="color:blue"><sup>1</sup></span>
* Builds on the "Maths of Simulating a Quantum Computer" with a concrete example.

<span style="color:blue"><sup>1</sup></span>A Quantum Oracle is usually a quantum version
of a classical function. It is possible to create a quantum version of any function
that can be implemented on a classical computer, with a few tweaks.
