# The Deutsch Jozsa Algorithm

The Deutsch Jozsa algorithm is a really simple Quantum algorithm which can do something faster
than any classical computer can today! This page will try to explain the steps
concretely so you can see exactly **how and why it works**.

### Caution

Please read [the Maths of Simulating a Quantum Computer](TheMathsOfSimulatingAQuantumComputer) if you
are new to Quantum computing. Quantum algorithms are quite Mathematical so you will want to be
comfortable with the basics before proceeding!
